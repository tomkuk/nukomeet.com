**It's been over a year since you started your work in Nukomeet. Tell us in a few words: how was that time for you?**

It was really something different than what I was doing before coming to Nukomeet. Before I was working for 3 years in a startup company. That means that I was working on one project, written in one technology. I was maintaining a relatively old codebase, adding new features, often facing the problem of the technical dept. During 1 year in Nukomeet I took part in 5 projects. Each for a timespan no longer than 3 months. And each written in different technologies for frontend and backend. Most of the time me being the person who bootstrapped the app and commited the first code.
 

**Can you describe us what sort of projects you do in Nukomeet?**

I do web apps. From small to medium size. I worked with an app for a contest organized by BMW, a digital catalog for an art museum, a brainstorm app etc. The variety is quite high. If I feel working in a specific project with a specific technology it's arrangeable.

**What technologies do you use?**

I use angular, react, clojurescript for frontend. Rails, grape, clojure for backend. Overall I have a lot of space for experimenting. Trying out new technologies, experiencing the strong and weak points of each of them.

**In Nukomeet we work mostly remotely. Do you enjoy this type of work?** 

The way my work is organized Nukomeet is also something different. In Nukomeet I can work entirely remotely. The time frames in which I work are flexible as well. It opens up interesting possibilities for travelling for me. I can just put some clothes and my laptop into the backpack and fly to some country and work from there as long as I have Internet connection. I estimate that from the last 12 months 4 of them I've spend working outside of my home. Which I find to be the best ratio for me.

**Can you say something more about your trips?**

Since I used to live in Barcelona I have a lot of friends there. So often I pack my laptop, buy a cheap plane ticket and go to visit them. I can work during the day and during the evening I hang out with them enjoying the city. Also I visit Kraków in Poland on similar basis.

A bigger trip I’ve done was to Latin America where I was for 2 months. My friend was going there and asked me if I feel like going with him. The majority of time I spend in Argentina in Buenos Aires and Mendoza. But I also managed to see Santiago de Chile, Valparaiso and Porto Alegre in Brazil. Doing that I was constantly working. Just finding wi-fi and power socket was sufficient.

Being in America I’ve met a lot of people backpacking through the continent. The number of kilometers and places they saw were pretty humbling comparing to my own achievements. But at the same time my goal was not to see as much as possible. It was more about to be in some distant place, experiencing the culture, and not sacrificing my work while doing that.
