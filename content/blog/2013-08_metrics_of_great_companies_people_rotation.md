People often asks me how I would define a « great company ». Some would say it's about earning money, it's business after all. Other would argue it's about creating a product people need and care about. In eyes of many, best companies are these who fulfil objectives for its clients and stakeholders in the first place - while not false, we tend to favor company’s external activity when asked the question. Those characteristics, however, should be a consequence as they refer to company's performance. It is not intense pressure nor hard exploitation, but internal well-being and integrity which should produce excellent results.

The company essence is people who decided to work together; it's a preliminary ingredient which is necessary to fulfil company's objectives. Great companies are those that focus on people. One of my favourite indicators of a great company is the number of people that left or was fired, I call it « people rotation metric ». Usually, the lower it stays the better the company seems. When people leave it's usually company's fault: when people's expectations diverge, it's a company responsibility to facilitate and reduce the tension; when people's goals rise, the company must keep up. Once this metric rises considerably, people are not treated as they should - there is something wrong whether related to pressure, exploitation or the way « together » is perceived.

At Nukomeet, we believe in a long-term commitment when it comes to forming a work environment. We set up a flat structure not to make an illusion for decisions making, but to truly and fully consolidate people within. It is only possible with an identical chance to act and perform. It's only the work that can make the difference. There is no other way around, otherwise it's just another golden cage.

And what are your metrics that may define a great company ?
