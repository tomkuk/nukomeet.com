On July 7th, the Tanabata Day in Japan, we had a Nukomeet Summit in Poznań. So we decided to make our own Tanabata in Nukomeet.

The idea is not to ask for gods or demons to realize your wish, but to take a moment to think about what you really want and its implications. Also to show it to the others .

Here are a few advices on how to write a proper Tanabata wish:

- Your wish should be written at the present, not at the future ("the company is profitable" for instance). 
- Think about the implications of your wish so you can wish it fully. For instance, if your wish is "I am sleeping with a different person every day", are you really willing to put so much energy in it and to deal with such a complicated life? Maybe "I have a happy sexuality" is more appropriate.  
- Once you have carefully written your wish, just forget about it.

It’s as a good way to be more clear with our desires, as individuals and as a company, and more determined to achieve it together.
